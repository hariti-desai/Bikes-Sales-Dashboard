# Bikes-Sales-Dashboard

This is an Excel file where I took the data from Kaggle and cleaned it for analysis to see where the bikes are sold out the most in which country.
The first sheet is bike_buyers which is raw data and I created another sheet of it naming it working_sheet where I cleaned and worked around data. I have another sheet in it where I created Pivot tables as well as dashboard sheets to create a visualization with filters.

In the Dashboards sheet, I have added a column chart of Average Income where we can tell average income based on gender when they buy a bike. Another line chart is also added which tells us the average age which has the most bikes sold out. The third chart shows the distance between customers buying bikes from which distances. 

Lastly, I have also added a slicer of Marital Status, Region, and Education based on which we can filter all three charts to show values.
